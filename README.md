# KeepingÂ for Homey

Use [Keeping](https://keeping.nl) with [Homey](https://homey.app).

This Homey app allows you to start or stop your timesheet timer when something triggers on your home automation hub (Homey).

For example, if you have a Homey at work you could start your timer automatically when you arrive, and stop it automatically when you leave.
